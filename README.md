# Excel import example using EPPlus with REST

This is a simple example of post an Excel file through POST HTTP method.

After run the code, I have tested with [Postman](https://www.postman.com/).

The Excel file sample:

![alt text][excelSample]


The Excel file was created by a LibreOffice Calc and exported as a xlsx file type.

The [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) request and response:

![alt text][postmanSample]

It was a POST HTTP method and the file sent as a content of a form data.
